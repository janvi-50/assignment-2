            <p>Risin' up, back in the street</p>
            <p >Did my time, took my chances</p>
            <p >Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet</p>
            <p>Just a man and his will to survive</p>
            <p>So many times, it happens too fast</p>
            <p>You trade your passion for glory</p>
            <p>Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past</p>
            <p>You must fight just to keep them alive</p>
            <p>It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight</p>
            <p>Risin' up to the challenge of our rival</p>
            <p>And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night</p>
            <p>And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger</p>
            <p>Face to face, out in the heat</p>
            <p>Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry</p>
            <p>They stack the odds still we take to the street</p>
            <p>For the kill with the skill to survive</p>
            <p>It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight</p>
            <p>Risin' up to the challenge of our rival</p>
            <p>And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night</p>
            <p>And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger</p>
            <p>Risin' up, straight to the top</p>
            <p>Had the guts, got the glory</p>
            <p>Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop</p>
            <p>Just a man and his will to survive</p>
            <p>It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight</p>
            <p>Risin' up to the challenge of our rival</p>
            <p>And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night</p>
            <p>And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger</p>
            <p>The eye of the tiger</p>
            <p>The eye of the tiger</p>
            <p>The eye of the tiger</p>
